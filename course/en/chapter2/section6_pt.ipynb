        "The tokenizer added the special word [CLS] at the beginning and the special word [SEP] at the end. This is because the model was pretrained with those, so to get the same results for inference we need to add them as well. Note that some models don’t add special words, or add different ones; models may also add these special words only at the beginning, or only at the end. In any case, the tokenizer knows which ones are expected and will take care of it automatically."
